## Features

### Multi-Tenancy (stancl/tenancy v3)
- **Database per Tenant:** Complete data isolation with automatic database creation and migration.
- **Domain Identification:** Tenants are identified by domains/subdomains.
- **Tenant Lifecycle Management:** Automated jobs for creating, migrating, and deleting tenant databases.
- **Tenant-Aware Services:** Filesystem, Cache, Queue, and Redis are configured to be tenant-aware.

### Central Administration (Filament v5)
- **Tenant Management:** Create, update, and delete tenants directly from the admin panel.
- **Subscription Billing:**
    - **Plans Management:** Create and manage flexible subscription plans.
    - **Subscription Tracking:** Monitor tenant subscriptions and statuses.
    - **Invoicing:** Generate and manage invoices for tenants.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** integrated with Filament Shield (v3) for granular permissions.

### Modern Stack
- **Framework:** Laravel 12
- **Admin Panel:** Filament v5
- **Frontend:** Livewire v4 + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Testing:** Pest v4
- **Tooling:** Laravel Pint (Code Style), Laravel Sail (Docker)

## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- Node.js & NPM
- MySQL 8.0+ (Recommended) or SQLite
- Redis

**Recommendation:** For local development, especially with subdomains, we highly recommend using [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet) (macOS) or [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/). These tools make handling `*.test` domains seamless.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tenancy-starterkit.git
    cd tenancy-starterkit
    ```

2.  **Install PHP dependencies**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install Node dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Environment Configuration**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
    Update your `.env` file with your database credentials. Ensure you have a central database created.
    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=tenancy_central
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```

5.  **Run Migrations & Seeds**
    This will migrate the central database and seed default roles/permissions.
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

6.  **Build Assets**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

7.  **Create an Admin User**
    ```bash
    php artisan make:filament-user
    ```

## Usage

### Local Development with Valet (Recommended)
If you are using Valet:
1.  Park or link your directory: `valet link tenancy-starterkit`
2.  Your app is now available at `http://tenancy-starterkit.test`.

### Accessing the Central Admin
Visit `http://tenancy-starterkit.test/admin` (or your configured domain) and log in with the admin user you created.

### Creating a Tenant
1.  Navigate to the **Tenants** resource in the admin panel.
2.  Click **New Tenant**.
3.  Fill in the tenant details and assign a domain.
    *   *Tip: Use subdomains like `foo` to access `foo.tenancy-starterkit.test` automatically with Valet.*
4.  The system will automatically:
    -   Create a new database for the tenant.
    -   Run tenant-specific migrations.
    -   Create the domain record.

### Accessing a Tenant
Once a tenant is created (e.g., with id `foo`), you can access their application at:
`http://foo.tenancy-starterkit.test`

## Automating Tenant Provisioning with Payments (Stripe Example)

A key feature of a SaaS application is automatically provisioning a new tenant account after a successful payment. Here’s a high-level guide on how to implement this using Stripe and Laravel Cashier.

The core idea is to create a Stripe webhook that, upon a successful payment, creates a `Tenant` model, which in turn triggers the automatic provisioning jobs.

1.  **Install Laravel Cashier (Stripe)**
    ```bash
    composer require laravel/cashier
    php artisan cashier:install
    php artisan migrate
    ```

2.  **Configure Stripe**
    Add your Stripe keys and a webhook secret to your `.env` file.
    ```env
    STRIPE_KEY=pk_...
    STRIPE_SECRET=sk_...
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
    ```

3.  **Create a Webhook Controller**
    This controller will handle incoming events from Stripe.
    ```bash
    php artisan make:controller StripeWebhookController
    ```
    In your `StripeWebhookController.php`, create a method to handle the `checkout.session.completed` event. This is where the magic happens.

4.  **Define the Webhook Route**
    In `routes/web.php`, create a route that points to your new controller. Remember to exclude it from CSRF protection.
    ```php
    Route::post(
        'stripe/webhook',
        [StripeWebhookController::class, 'handleWebhook']
    )->name('cashier.webhook');
    ```

5.  **Implement the Controller Logic**
    Inside your `handleWebhook` method:
    -   Verify the webhook signature.
    -   Get the user and payment details from the Stripe session object.
    -   **Crucially, create the `Tenant` record.** You can pass user details or generate a unique ID.
        ```php
        // Example logic in your controller
        $session = $event->data['object'];
        $user = User::find($session->client_reference_id);

        $tenant = App\Models\Central\Tenant::create([
            'id' => 'tenant-' . uniqid(),
            'name' => $user->name . "'s Team",
            'owner_id' => $user->id,
        ]);
        
        $tenant->createDomain([
            'domain' => strtolower(str_replace(' ', '', $user->name))
        ]);
        ```

6.  **Automatic Provisioning**
    That's it! The `TenancyServiceProvider` is already configured to listen for the `TenantCreated` event. Once the `Tenant` model is created in the webhook, the service provider will automatically trigger the job pipeline to:
    -   Create the tenant's database.
    -   Run the tenant's migrations.
    -   Perform any other setup jobs you've defined.

7.  **Frontend Integration**
    You will need to build a UI for users to select a plan and initiate the Stripe Checkout session. The `app/Filament/Pages/PurchasePlan.php` is a great starting point for this.

## Testing

This project uses **Pest** for testing and comes with a foundational test suite to ensure the core multi-tenancy and Filament features are working as expected. We highly recommend you extend this test suite as you build out your application.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run tests with a compact report
php artisan test --compact

# Run a specific test file (e.g., feature test)
php artisan test tests/Feature/Central/TenantLifecycleTest.php

# Run unit tests
php artisan test --group=unit
```

### Existing Test Structure

-   **`tests/Feature/Central/`**: Contains feature tests for the central application, covering functionalities such as:
    -   `InvoiceTest.php`: Tests invoice-related features.
    -   `SubscriptionTest.php`: Tests subscription management.
    -   `TenantLifecycleTest.php`: Essential tests for tenant creation, migration, and deletion.
    -   `UserTest.php`: Tests user management and authentication.
-   **`tests/Feature/Tenant/AppTest.php`**: A basic feature test for the tenant-specific application, ensuring it loads correctly. This is a good starting point for your tenant-specific feature tests.
-   **`tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php`**: An example unit test.

### Extending Your Test Suite

-   **Central Application Tests:** When adding new features to your central admin panel (e.g., new Filament resources, custom pages, or central API endpoints), create new feature tests in `tests/Feature/Central/`.
-   **Tenant Application Tests:** For any features specific to the tenant application (e.g., tenant-specific models, controllers, or API endpoints), create feature tests in `tests/Feature/Tenant/`. Remember to leverage [Pest's multi-tenancy testing utilities](https://tenancyforlaravel.com/docs/v3/testing#testing-with-tenancy) when interacting with tenant contexts.
-   **Unit Tests:** For isolated logic (e.g., service classes, complex helper functions, or model methods without database interaction), create unit tests in `tests/Unit/`.

## Architecture Overview

### Central Context (`App\Models\Central`)
Models and logic related to the management of the SaaS platform itself.
-   **User:** Administrators of the central application.
-   **Tenant:** The entity representing a customer account.
-   **Domain:** The domain(s) associated with a tenant.
-   **Plan/Subscription/Invoice:** Billing-related models.

### Tenant Context (`App\Models\Tenant`)
Models and logic specific to the tenant's application.
-   *Currently empty boilerplate.*
-   Define your application's specific models here (e.g., `Product`, `Order`, `Post`).
-   Migrations for these models go in `database/migrations/tenant`.

### Routing
-   `routes/web.php`: Routes for the Central Application (Landing page, Admin Panel).
